<h1>Music for the Moving Image - Afonso Ferrão</h1>
<h2>a2 - Short Film</h2>
<p>This video is called “Fear of Motion”. I did it as if there was a person or just an identity with feelings watching the cars passing by. The intensity of the music is directly related with the amount of cars passing and their speed, for as more cars pass, more anxious and scared this identity feels. The music is to be seen a the person's feeling. Because the right hand side is without cars, there is a calm background sound. I tried to find sound and chords that conveyed those emotions to illustrate this idea. </p>

<h2>a5 - Synaesthesia</h2>
<p>With this video I tried to illustrate a love story between two creatures from a deep and dark place. The lights are both the creatures and their voices. As the lights move, the creatures communicate and throughout the video their sounds will be less dissonant ultil they match the background guitar. I used panning automation to create the sense that each creature was speaking from one side.

<h2>a1 - Imaginary Soundscape</h2>
<p>This audio is based on the sentence "Nude Beach, Nothing new, Under the sun". My idea was to portrait someone in a nude beach, alone. I imagined a calm beach where you can only listen to the sound of the sea and the "sound of the sun". The chords I chose to this song meant to pass on
